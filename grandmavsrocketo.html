            <p>At CART as one of our final projects we were told to start doing a text adventure game. My partner and I had great expectations for this project, we really like games so we wanted to do something really cool.</p>
            <p>This project was really fun to code, the Javascript was hard but with some experience in Unity I was able to make the game using a vector map so the character can be sought by enemies and it can move through the map. We also did all the sprites and story. At the end of this project I ended with a complete experience of how to make a 2d game.</p>
