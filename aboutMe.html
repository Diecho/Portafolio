                <p>Hello! My name is Diego Hidalgo, a passionate student in software engineering with a knack for frontend development. Efficiency is one of my key strengths, as I firmly believe that good solutions are not truly good if they take an eternity to be implemented. I am a logical person by nature, all my life I have had an innate sense of how to do things to achieve my goals.</p>
                <p>My educational journey began in Chile, my birthplace, where my love with math first took root. However, my quest for knowledge led me to the United States, where I started my highschool education.</p>
                <p>As I keep getting deeper into the realm of mathematics, I'm constantly inspired by its beauty and utility. In my last year of high school, I took AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C. Both courses make me love math more than always. Now as my Post-secondary education I plan to transfer to a prestigious UC institution to keep learning about mathematics and computer engineering.</p>

                <h3>Rubik's cubes</h3>
                <p>I always wanted to solve a Rubik's cube and at 11 years old I finally did it. I had solved more than 20 different types of cubes. Currently I like to solve the 3x3 with methods like the Fridrich.</p>
